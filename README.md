# Fun with Assembly

The files in here are just some basic nasm tutorial walk throughs... basic_asm_structures are part of a self GAS analysis.  

## basic_asm_structures directoy
This is just a basic GAS output reference to see how basic programming constructs are translated into GNU/AT&T ASM
through GCC. Each ASM compiled filed (.s) has various optimizations either added or removed and can be diff'd for
learning how the compiler is effecting the resulting assembly output. 

Code written and generated by john@hire-john.com with gcc.
